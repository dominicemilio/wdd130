    <h2>Dominic Emilio Clemence</h2>
    <h2>My Nickname is Nick!</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Dominic, although I use my middle name in South America where I
      live. Funny thing!! My real nickname is Nick
    </p>

      I’ve decided to make a career change because it’s always been my dream to
      finish my university studies. For that reason, I’ve made the drastic
      decision to pursue something totally different. I’ve chosen Software
      Development as my new career path.

      I love to sing and play my guitar. I also love toying around with Linux.
      I’ve primarily used Linux as my daily driver for the last 28 years.

      My wife and I have 5 children and 11 grandchildren. It’s a great mix of
      different cultures. I am from the USA while my wife is from Colombia. Some
      of our family live in the US, while others live closer to us in Colombia.

      As a linguist, I speak and teach: English, Spanish, Italian, and
      Portuguese. I am making a complete 180º change to my career because I’d
      always dreamed of Programming.

      I have very fond memories of Ricks College, where I graduated with an A.A.
      degree in 1988. I love the fact that this educational institution has
      evolved into something that is so relevant today. It’s so amazing to me
      that I live on the other side of the world, and yet can return to the same
      place where I started my upper education 35 years ago!

      I don’t know that I’ll really be able to pursue this as a career because
      of my health. Nevertheless, I’m sure going to try! I’ve chosen Software
      Development because I’m a linguist. Why not move from spoken languages to
      software languages?

      I’ve been an active member of the church since I was an adolescent. I also
      had the experience of completing a full-time mission for the church. My
      favorite quote was given to us by the true head of the Church, even Jesus
      Christ! His quote is to “Love one another”

      Mark 9:23 Jesus said unto him, “If thou canst believe, all things are
      possible to him that believeth”
